        <p>Andrew Fancher’s interest in WWII began when he was nine years old. While sifting through old family
          photographs, he stumbled on one of a young man in Army uniform. Handwritten on the back of this old black and
          white postcard was “Italy, 1945.” Andy quickly discovered this individual was his late-great grandfather,
          Gene T. Fancher. Being young, he had many questions regarding this individual’s service, but very few answers
          from the family. As it turns out, Gene shared no detail of his personal WWII experience before his early
          death in 1970. And so, because of the unknown, Andy Fancher’s curiosity in this momentous war began.</p>
        <p>He went online regularly and watched countless documentaries on the history channel. He realized the
          significance of our Allied powers’ victory and knew we as a society were in great debt to these WWII
          veterans. However, Andy felt something was missing from society; the first-hand accounts of the men and women
          who lived it. In short, Fancher felt a calling to meet his heroes, and capture their stories. He created a
          Youtube page under his name and designated the project Andy Fancher Presents. One month into age 16, his
          first WWII veteran was interviewed. That was nearly two years ago. Andy is now 19, and currently pursuing a
          degree in broadcast journalism. He has spoken with WWII veterans from all walks of life, from all military
          branches, from all combat theaters. A handful of these 90+ year-old service members have become more than
          just his heroes, but family.</p>

        <p>Andy has attended book signings, birthday parties, routine lunches, car shows, and visits to
          the VA Hospital. Andy Fancher Presents has been featured on NBC 5, Dallas Morning News, FOX 4, CBS 11, and
          NBC National News with Lester Holt. Andy’s project has picked up great speed, and won’t be slowing down
          anytime soon. He will continue to do the best he can, with all he’s got, to preserve the fading stories of
          our greatest generation.</p>
