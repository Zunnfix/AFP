        <p class="article-p">This week I traveled to Rockwall County and interviewed a veteran of both World War II and
          Korea; Master Sergeant Vernon “Rip” Ribera. We met at the 90-year-old’s quaint North-Texas home to discuss
          his captivating life from poverty to military service.</p>
        <p class="article-p">Before the Armed Forces, Vernon survived a plight of his own; childhood in Boswell,
          Oklahoma. Both of his parents had perished by age seven, leaving him and five other siblings to raise
          each-other. They worked “daylight ‘till dark” on a rural homestead with no running water or electricity.
          Often, Vernon would sneak off to the barn and consume horse and cow feed for a meal. “It was just a bleak
          existence” which dramatically changed in early-1945. Two months after graduating high-school, at age sixteen,
          Vernon Ribera enlisted in the Merchant Marines.</p>

          <p class="quote">“I’m not 90! I’m 18 with 72 years of experience!”</p>
        </div>
        <p class="article-p">Upon completion of basic training in Florida, Vernon was assigned to a liberty ship which
          soon after voyaged across the embattled Atlantic. He would serve two tours overseas, having traveled to South
          Africa, Belgium, Columbia, and Cuba. Upon his final return to the states, the two atomic bombs were dropped
          on Japan, concluding all combat against Axis powers. He remained in San Francisco for several months
          following the end of World War II, essentially a civilian as he never redeemed his Merchant Marine contract.
          In result, he was drafted by the U.S Army in late-1945.</p>
        <p class="article-p">After years of rigorous training, Vernon achieved the rank of Master Sergeant. In the fall
          of 1950, his 45th Infantry Division was mobilized, and deployed for Korea. Vernon and his forty-eight men
          landed on the beaches of Inchon, where they were met by friendly South Korean forces and led to the west
          central front. In December of 1951, the first patrol commenced. Over the next hand full of grueling patrols,
          Vernon and his unit would be continuously “baptized by enemy bullets,” ultimately resulting in the horrendous
          deaths of four men; “I saw these boys get their heads blown off right next to me. This wasn’t your typical
          John Wayne shootout.” After a year of receiving baths every two months, Vernon and his remaining men were
          finally sent home.</p>
        <p class="article-p">As of today, Vernon Ribera remains very busy. He continuously dedicated his mornings to
          the American Legion in Rockwall, and actively operates a wood-shop out of his home garage.</p>
